		<h2>Indoor Birding</h2>
		<p class="byline">Alex Olivier & Jason Alderman</p>
		<p class="where">Exhibited at Synthetically Natural, 2016</p>
		<p>Classic Audubon bird illustrations were often drawn from deceased specimens. Indoor Birding takes inspiration from these drawings, but showcases the birds as they behave in the wild.</p>
		<p>The installation features a wall of picture frames, each filled with an outdoor scene. At random intervals, the previously static birds spring to life and animate across the scene. The birds fly and chirp, each singing a signature call of their species. Viewers can look through binoculars get a closer view of the birds, just as they might in the wild.</p>
		<p>All included birds are local to the San Diego area and feature sounds from the Cornell Ornithology Library.

		<h2>What's For Dinner?</h2>
		<p class="byline">Laura Dudek & Alex Olivier</p>
		<p class="where">Exhibited at Wake, Ship In The Woods, 2017</p>
		<p><em>What’s For Dinner?</em> is a reflection on the fragility and complexity of ecological systems, the dependencies that sustain them, and the impact of human interference.</p>
		<p>We are largely removed from the ecological networks that sustain us. Lack of exposure has systematically desensitized us from the repercussions our activity has on the natural world. Through our actions, we compromise the integrity of these delicately tuned networks––threatening not just their existence, but our own.</p> 
		<p>A fragile matrix of complex webbing, What’s For Dinner? invites participants to contemplate their place in and impact on the world around them.</p>

		<h2>Webbed World</h2>
		<p class="byline">Laura Dudek & Lucy Boyd-Wilson</p>
		<p class="where">Exhibited at Figment, 2017</p>
		<p>Webbed World is an opportunity for individuals to come together and experience the transformational power of communities.</p>
		<p>Participants are encouraged to add webbing to the domed-world and modify the collective creation. The dome is a constantly evolving ecosystem that reflects the unique spirit of our San Diego community.​</p>

		<h2>Erosion: Song For Cliffs</h2>
		<p class="byline">Alex Olivier, JC Nesci, Laura Asher, Colin Wageman</p>
		<p class="where">Exhibited at Convergence, Ship In The Woods, 2016</p>
		<p>The piece explores the relationship between San Diego’s natural landscape and the human cultural artifacts that flourish alongside it.</p>
		<p>A playlist of 60s surf tracks play from speakers embedded in the piece. Like waves eroding the coastline, the songs are distorted by a series of digital transforms.</p>
		<p>As viewers approach, distortions fade away and the song becomes recognizable. The viewers hear the sounds clearly as they begin to see the waves below the cliffs.</p>

		<h2>Roomination</h2>
		<p class="byline">Laura Dudek & Peri Smith</p>
		<p class="where">Exhibited at Synthetically Natural, 2016</p>
		<p><em>Roomination</em> is an exercise in mindfulness and presents an opportunity for one to explore self-created boundaries. The piece is part physical and part experiential. As an object, <em>Roomination</em> plays upon the idea of infinity—using mirrors and LEDs to reflect upon itself—and creates the impression of endlessness. In this respect, it is a microcosm of the larger experience. Each user is invited to make <em>Roomination</em> a room of one’s own; to enter and reflect upon the self, the void beyond, and the boundaries in between.</p>
		<p>This piece was inspired by the concept of time and Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. It is a wooden, mirror-lined sculpture embedded with individually addressable LEDs. Using Processing and Arduino, the structure converts .mp3 files to light patterns, resulting in a unique, music-responsive light show within the mirrored room.</p>
